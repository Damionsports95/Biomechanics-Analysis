I am a sport scientist still awaiting new opportunities to jumpstart my career. 

I created this project for two reasons:

First, I could not find enough scripts using the Kinetics Toolkit (KTK) package for biomechanical analysis in Python. Therefore, I thought it would be fun to challenge myself by using KTK to practice my coding skills while continuously learning and experimenting with something different from the usual.

Second, I believe we can all benefit from the great minds out there contributing to the learning of new skills every day. Any contributions to this project are welcome. I hope to use this opportunity to help those who are also trying to improve their coding skills and perfect their analysis.
